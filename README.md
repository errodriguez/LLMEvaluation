EvidentlyAI LLM Evaluation Course - cohort 2025

To set up this project, first download the `setup.sh` script into a directory that will hold both this repository and the original from EvidentlyAI. Set execution mode if necessary (`chmod u+x setup.sh`) and execute the script.

- A conda environment will be created.
- If it doesn't exist, a security folder is created, and inside, a file is stored to keep personal access tokens.
- Additional instructions to manually clone the required repos and to install basic Python packages are shown on the screen.

Finally, don't forget to populate the keys file (By default under `Vault/keys.sh`).
